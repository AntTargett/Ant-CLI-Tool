# Ant CLI Tool (imanant tool)

Idea from [Kyle Robinson Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9xGEJ80jjs) who created a cli tool that printed out askii art

Cli tool that prints out aski ant art when typing in the command imanant :ant:

Find my package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imanant) :ant:

npm install -g imanant

#### Commands

-   list : Lists the profiles available and the current profile
